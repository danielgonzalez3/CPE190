Project Athena - Quadrupedal Objection Detection System

Our team and robotic system combats the issue of recurring and increasing wildfires throughout the US and world in the past 50 years. Climate change has contributed greatly to a change in weather patterns that have led us into elongated drought periods and heat waves that create the perfect environment for wildfires to thrive. Wildfires not only affect the environment but also impact the lives and belongings of thousands of individuals across the state. Due to increasing population and settlement within new terrains, communities are not prepared to evacuate in case of a fire. A solution is needed to aid in recovery efforts when fires are moving at a pace faster than the public can react to. Our project is oriented to the deployment of a robotic system capable of recording temperatures and detecting wildlife/humans within the scope of its vicinity. This system will operate through machine learning architecture used to recognize certain objects and electrical sensors to record data. This system will be controlled with a mobile device via Apache web service and operate within different external environmental changes with multi-terrain capabilities which would greatly benefit both the environments where these fires take place and the firefighters who defend them. We plan to retrieve data using our advanced sensors as well as Machine Learning Architecture such as tensorflow to best distinguish the surrounding environment. By deploying such a system we can reduce the response time needed for first responders to analyze the situation and act accordingly, ultimately leading to a decrease in the casualties of severe fires.
